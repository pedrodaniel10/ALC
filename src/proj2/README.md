# ALC - 2019/2020 - Project 2
Algorithms for Computational Logic's project.

## Introduction
The program outputs the smallest decision tree that classifies the given samples. It runs first the ID3 algorithm [[Qui86](http://www.hunch.net/~coms-4771/quinlan.pdf)] to retrieve a small valid tree using heuristics. The ID3 doesn't guarantee to return the smallest tree, so the program uses it as an upper bound. From that point, it calls multiple times the SMT solver in descendent order of the number of nodes (only with odd numbers) until finds an _UNSAT_ encoding. In the best case, ID3 returns the smallest tree with **N** nodes and there is only one SMT call to check the existence of a tree with **N-2** nodes that returns _UNSAT_.

**_DISCLAIMER:_** The ID3 algorithm's implementation was not made by me! It was downloaded from https://github.com/tofti/python-id3-trees and adapted by me to this problem

The encoding is outputted to a file **smt_lib**, with SMT-LIB directives that encodes the problem and is then fed to the SMT solver.

The encoding is a straightforward implementation from [[Narodytska et al](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0189.pdf)]. There were just a few optimizations, mainly in the following constraints:
- **Constraint 1:** I also explicitly say that the nodes numbered N-1 and N are leaves. Meaning that I add 2 constraints saying that v<sub>N-1</sub> and v<sub>N</sub> are **true**.
- **Constraint 2 and 11:** I skip the iteration where i=1, as v<sub>1</sub> is the root and non-leaf.
- **Constraint 4, 5 and 10:** I skip the iterations where i=N-1 and i=N, as those nodes are already leaves.
- **Constraint 12 and 13:** I skip the iteration where j=1, as the node 1 is the root and non-leaf.
- Added additional constraints λ and τ: improved performance by a factor of 10 in some cases.

Other notes:
- For the calculation of LR(i) and RR(i) I added one more constraint beyond parity that is that the difference between i and the element of those sets be greater or equal than 1 and 2 respectively to avoid wrong possible children.
- Also, wrong children, meaning that doesn't belong to LR(i) or RR(i) are set to false (added as constraint). 

## Requirements
- GNU/Linux
- Python 3
- Z3 (there is a x86-64 ELF executable in the present folder)

It can also use CVC4 as SMT solver, just need to change line 6 to:
```python
solver = solvers["cvc4"]
```

## How to run
The program assumes that the SMT solver (z3) is in the same directory where the program runs. So, in order to run without problems:

And you can run in various ways like:

```bash
    python ./proj2.py 
```
Or like:
```bash
    ./proj2
```

The program expects input for stdin, so you can feed him with an example file:
```bash
    ./proj2 < example.smp
```
